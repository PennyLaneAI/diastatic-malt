# DiastaticMalt

DiastaticMalt is a tool for source-to-source transformations and operator
overloading in Python, including the overloading built-in Python keywords.
It can be utilized to transform regular Python code into a new form better
suited for specific purposes, such as program capture.

The contents of DiastaticMalt are copied with modification from the TensorFlow project,
in particular the [AutoGraph](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.0/api_docs/python/tf/autograph)
module, under the Apache 2.0 license, allowing the use of AutoGraph functionality without
depending on TensorFlow. The modifications made here may eventually be contributed
to TensorFlow.

## Installation

DiastaticMalt can be installed via ``pip``:

```console
pip install diastatic-malt
```
